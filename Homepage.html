		<c style= "color:red;"> <f style=font-size:24px;> I have played organized sports since I was three. It started with soccer and grew to basketball and football as well. My Televison is basically locked on an ESPN channel. 
		Now that I am unable to play as much as I might like I religiously follow about a dozen sports teams and keep up to date with all the major leagues both in the United States and in Europe. </f> </c>
