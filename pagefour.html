		<c style= "color:red;"> <f style=font-size:24px;> The Los Angeles Clippers are a basketball team in the National Basketball Association. Famously bought by Steve Ballmer after the last an epic racist rant recorded and released to the public. He was later deemed mentally unfit to own the team. Chris Paul, Blake Griffin
		 and Paul Pierce are some of the marque players currently on their roster. They are coached by former Celtics coach Doc Rivers, also on the team is his son Austin Rivers. Next up they take on the Milwaukee Bucks Friday night 8pm. You can see the clippers website </f> </c>
